And what if i create class with constants and other functional classes will inherit it? 


class topo(Client-port)(num,rate,buf)
# create port(with in/out rate buf) and num of clients 
# s
class Switch(Client-port,  )
# build switch and learn all clients
Self.port[i].clients[] - its not neccessary to work eith clients directly. 
#we choose src client for tgen and randomize for dst client 
Class trafficgen(Client-port.ports
   #initialize in cycle: foreach client in topo1.clients
#tg1=trafficgen(env, src=client.id, dst=random.choice
